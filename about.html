            <p><b> Hello! My full name is Pace Morehead Lee and I am originally from
        Brooklyn, New York. I grew up in a neighborhood called Williamsburg,
      which many today consider the place of origination of the "hipster." My parents
      are actually both artists who moved into this area in the '80s. My mother
      is of Korean and Japanese descent while my father is American.
      <br><br>
      In high school I was a very fast mid-distance runner. I was the Manhattan
      Borough Champion in the 400m, 600m and 800m in my senior year.
      After graduating from high school I attended the University of Chicago where
      I studied Political Science. Chicago is a fantastic city and I really quite
      enjoyed my time there. I also continued to run for 2 years at UChicago as
      well as working on a Bitcoin startup during my time there.
      <br><br>
      After graduating in 2015 I moved back to New York where I worked as a
      Sales Consultant at a startup called Oscar Health. After some time I moved
      to another startup called Signpost also working in sales. Although I found
      myself to be quite successful in the sales roles I held, I started to take
      issue with the fact that many skills one learns in sales are what I would
      call non-tangible. Even though there is a lot to learn, it is in some
      sense difficult to fully demonstrate said skillset. As a result I started
      looking into web development as I was always intrigued by the work the
      developers at the companies I worked for were doing. Fast forward a bit
      and I found myself at Accelerate! I look forward to continuing the learning
      journey!
